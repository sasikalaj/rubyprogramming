# See all other examples for the include

# In short include is something like java inheritance.
# When a class extends a module , class inherits only the non class compoents from the modules that is that are
# not declared within class << self or def self.method
# All the remaining methods are included as instance component of the class that includes it
# and if there are similar named methods in module and class, class methods takes precedence

#refer to self_modules_classes
